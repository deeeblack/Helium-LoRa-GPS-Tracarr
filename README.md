# LoRa-GPS-Tracarr
Helium LoRaWan GP Tracker data into Tracarr



## STEP 1.
On-board LoRaWAN tracker to Helium console.
  - Either Get DevEUI, AppEUI and App Key from Helium console and configure LoRaWan Tracker to suit, or insert from Tracker to Console. Usually I just generate them from     Console and change my device.
  - Set Region of the device to either AU915-6 or AS923-1 for Dual Plan in Australia, **(This is going to change as at 18th April for Helium, they will revert back to      AU915 FSB2.)**


## STEP 2.
